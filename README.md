# Learning Rust
---

This is the GitHub Repository I am using to track my learning of rust. I don't usually spend time formally learning languages like this but the Rust Team has kindly provived [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) which is a very good resource to go through and I have nothing better to do (false!) so I'm going trhough the book at a snails pace (aka when I get time) 

For those of you unfamiliar with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (what are you doing?) it's got some weird mechanincs that are different from every other language ever so I guess that's why I want to take my time with this one? Anyways, would highly recommend reading the book!!
